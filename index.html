        <p>Easily the most interesting thing about me is my 3-legged Yorkshire terrier named Stumpy.  Here he is dressed as a pirate for halloween, complete with peg leg.  But do not let his looks fool you; he can be a mean SOB.  Typical terrier, but he is the best!</p>
        <p>Besides my best friend, I am known for being a CPA that jumped ship and took the dive into the startup world.  Over the last 6 years, my founders and I have grown www.fullscript.com to become one of the fastest growing companies in Ottawa.  Having completed a merger with a US company, we now have a team of 230+ talented staff and over $10M in monthly recurring revenue. </p>
        <p>But despite this size, we continue to be a true start-up, never standing still and always looking for better ways to do things.  Case in point, after 6 years of running operations and finance, and constantly struggling to find talent that live at the intersection of software engineering and business processes, I have decided to roll up my sleeves and be that person.</p>
        <p>As I have yet to create a portfolio of any kind, I have decided to treat you to pictures of other cute dogs.</p>
